||| Evil Weevil ABI v0 — layout computation and proofs.
|||
||| The layout model is deliberately minimal: fields are laid out in declared
||| order, each at the running sum of the sizes before it. There is no alignment
||| arithmetic in the MODEL, because the field lists in `Abi.Types` are ordered so
||| that no implicit padding ever arises — where padding would otherwise appear, an
||| explicit named pad field is declared instead.
|||
||| == Three layers, each able to fail loudly
|||
|||   * THIS MODULE proves each struct's offsets and total size, and that every
|||     offset satisfies its field's alignment.
|||   * The generated C header carries `_Static_assert(offsetof(...) ==
|||     EE_OFFSET_...)`, so the C COMPILER confirms the declared offsets are the
|||     real ones on the target, and complains if it would insert padding.
|||   * The generated Zig file carries the same numbers, and the Zig kernel asserts
|||     its own `@offsetOf`/`@sizeOf` against them at comptime.
|||
||| No proof here claims a given compiler WILL place fields at these offsets —
||| that is precisely what the static asserts are for. The proofs establish that
||| the offsets are the intended ones, are self-consistent, and are
||| alignment-correct; the compiler asserts establish that the intent was realised.
|||
||| == Why the theorems spell out the size lists
|||
||| Idris2 does not reduce in a proof position:
|||
|||   * `map f xs` (it becomes an opaque `mapImpl`),
|||   * a top-level constant (so `offsetsOf versionSizes` stays stuck; `%inline`
|||     does not change this — measured), or
|||   * `String` equality.
|||
||| So each theorem is stated over a LITERAL size list rather than the named list
||| in `Abi.Types`. That duplication is the point of `sizesOf` below and of the
||| generator's cross-check: `Abi.Gen` recomputes the sizes from the NAMED field
||| lists and compares them against the declared lists, refusing to emit anything
||| if they differ. So the chain is:
|||
|||   field names (Types) --sizesOf--> runtime check --==--> literal sizes
|||                                                                |
|||                                                        proofs (Layout)
|||                                                                |
|||                                              emitted constants (Gen)
|||                                                                |
|||                                       compiler asserts (C + Zig)
|||
||| A field added to the named list but not the literal one fails `just abi-check`
||| with a named struct and no output written. A field added to both, but with an
||| offset that no longer matches the theorems, fails to typecheck here.

public export
fieldSizeC : (String, CType) -> Nat
fieldSizeC (_, t) = sizeOf t

||| The sizes implied by a NAMED field list. This is what `Abi.Gen` compares
||| against the declared lists; it is a runtime function precisely because `map`
||| does not reduce in a proof position (see the module header).
public export

||| `n` is a whole number of `unit`s. Written with structural recursion on `n` so
||| it computes for closed Nats (the same reason `mod` cannot be used here).
public export

  case n of
    Z => True
    S k => if k + 1 == unit then True else if k + 1 < unit then False else isMultipleOf unit k

||| The alignment unit every struct in this ABI is padded to. 8 is not a
||| preference: it is the widest member (u64) and the reason the C compiler needs
||| no implicit padding in any of the seven structs.
public export
structAlignUnit : Nat
structAlignUnit = 8

||| Does this padding arrangement work out regardless of where the struct starts —
||| i.e. is the struct's size a whole number of its alignment units, so that an
||| array of them has no gap and `stride == size`? That is the property that makes
||| `ee_snapshot snapshots[N]` safe and the reason every struct here is padded to a
||| multiple of 8.
|||
||| This used to read `totalOf ss == totalOf ss`, which is true of every list and
||| therefore checks nothing. It is now a real predicate, and it is LOAD-BEARING
||| rather than decorative: `Abi.Gen` refuses to emit a struct whose stride is not
||| safe, so a padding mistake stops generation instead of shipping.
|||
||| Stated as a runtime predicate rather than a theorem for the reason recorded in
||| the module header: `mod` reduces on literals but not on a stuck application, so
||| `strideEqSize fields = True` is not a proposition Idris2 0.7.0 will discharge by
||| computation over a computed size. The alignment theorems below remain the
||| proof layer, stated over the literal sizes; this is the gate.
