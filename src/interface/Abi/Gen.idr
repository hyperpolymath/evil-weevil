||| Evil Weevil ABI v0 — the generator.
|||
||| Emits, from the type model in `Abi.Types`:
|||
|||   * `include/evil_weevil/ee.h`          — the C ABI every host compiles against
|||   * `src/interface/generated/ee_layout.zig` — the same numbers for Zig's comptime asserts
|||
||| and refuses to emit anything at all if the model is internally inconsistent.
|||
||| == Why this exists
|||
||| `Abi.Layout` proves offsets and sizes about LITERAL size lists, because Idris2
||| will not reduce a named constant in a proof position. The field lists in
||| `Abi.Types` are the human-maintained truth; the literal lists are the proven
||| ones. This program recomputes the sizes from the NAMED lists, compares them to
||| the DECLARED lists, and exits non-zero on any difference — so the two cannot
||| drift apart unnoticed. That check is the whole reason a generator is worth
||| having here rather than a hand-written header.
|||
||| Run: `just abi-gen` (or `just abi-check`, which regenerates and diffs).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Rendering primitives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

||| A C type name for each model type. Total, so a new CType without a name here
||| is a compile error rather than a silent omission from the header.
cName : CType -> String
cName U8 = "uint8_t"
cName U16 = "uint16_t"
cName U32 = "uint32_t"
cName U64 = "uint64_t"
cName I32 = "int32_t"
cName I64 = "int64_t"
cName Fx = "ee_fx"
cName CVersion = "ee_version"
cName CContact = "ee_contact"

fieldDecl : (String, CType) -> String
fieldDecl (n, t) = "  " ++ cName t ++ " " ++ n ++ ";"

||| `#define EE_CAP_NAVMESH (1u << 0)` — the shift comes from `capBit`, so the
||| numbers in the header are the model's, never retyped.
capDefine : Capability -> String
capDefine c = "#define EE_CAP_" ++ capName c ++ " (1u << " ++ show (capBit c) ++ "u)"

||| The capability's MASK (1 << bit), which is what both files must carry: the C
||| header computes it with a shift, so the Zig constant has to be the same number,
||| not the bit index. Emitting the index here would compile, and would silently
||| mean something else in each language — the exact class of drift this file exists
||| to make impossible.
pow2 : Nat -> Nat
pow2 Z = 1
pow2 (S k) = 2 * pow2 k

capMask : Capability -> Nat
capMask c = pow2 (capBit c)

statusDefine : Status -> String
statusDefine s = "#define EE_STATUS_" ++ statusName s ++ " " ++ show (statusCode s)

actionDefine : Action -> String
actionDefine a = "#define EE_ACTION_" ++ actionName a ++ " " ++ show (actionCode a)

||| Intent flags, emitted rather than hand-copied. The Zig side used to declare its
||| own INTENT_FLAG_* constants with the same numbers typed in by hand, and the C
||| header had none at all — so a host could not name the bits it was being handed,
||| and the two languages could disagree without anything noticing. These are
||| bit VALUES (1, 2, 4, 8), not bit indices: `<<` is written into the header for
||| the reader's benefit and the value is what the kernel ors together.
intentFlagDefine : (String, Nat) -> String
intentFlagDefine (n, v) = "#define EE_INTENT_FLAG_" ++ n ++ " " ++ show v ++ "u"

intentFlagZigConst : (String, Nat) -> String

  [ ("DEGRADED", intentFlagDegraded)
  , ("NEW_TARGET", intentFlagNewTarget)
  , ("UNREACHABLE", intentFlagUnreachable)
  , ("FROM_MEMORY", intentFlagFromMemory)
  ]

||| Bits in `ee_agent.flags` — the agent's own state, as opposed to the intent it
||| just produced. Emitted for the same reason the intent flags are: a bit a host
||| cannot name is a bit a host cannot check.
agentFlagDefine : (String, Nat) -> String
agentFlagDefine (n, v) = "#define EE_AGENT_FLAG_" ++ n ++ " " ++ show v ++ "u"

agentFlagZigConst : (String, Nat) -> String
agentFlagZigConst (n, v) = "pub const AGENT_FLAG_" ++ n ++ ": u32 = " ++ show v ++ ";"

public export
allAgentFlags : List (String, Nat)
allAgentFlags = [ ("MEMORY_VALID", agentFlagMemoryValid) ]

||| The agent's mode field (ADR-0012): a shift, a mask and the codes that go in it.
||| Emitted because the mode IS on the wire — it lives in `ee_agent.flags`, which the
||| host owns and can inspect — unlike the margin that produces it, which is policy and
||| stays out of the header (ADR-0010 §3).
agentModeDefine : (String, Nat) -> String
agentModeDefine (n, v) = "#define EE_AGENT_MODE_" ++ n ++ " " ++ show v ++ "u"

agentModeZigConst : (String, Nat) -> String
agentModeZigConst (n, v) = "pub const AGENT_MODE_" ++ n ++ ": u32 = " ++ show v ++ ";"

-- Checksumming the layout
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

||| Sum of each value times its 1-based position. Any change of value, or any
||| reordering, moves it; the growth is bounded by construction (values are field
||| sizes, so the total stays in the low millions).
weighted : Nat -> List Nat -> Nat
weighted i [] = 0
weighted i (v :: vs) = v * (i + 1) + weighted (S i) vs

flat : List (List Nat) -> List Nat
flat [] = []
flat (x :: xs) = x ++ flat xs

||| Every field size in the ABI, in struct and field order.
allSizes : List Nat
allSizes = flat (map (sizesOf . sFields) allStructs)

||| The ABI checksum: position-weighted sum of every field size, mixed with the
||| field count and the struct count.
|||
||| Two honest limitations, stated rather than discovered later:
|||
|||   * This is a DRIFT DETECTOR, not a cryptographic hash. It detects accidental
|||     divergence (a resized field, a reordered field, a dropped field) with no
|||     false negatives; it does not resist a deliberate collision, and nothing in
|||     ADR-0005 needs it to.
|||   * It is arithmetic on Nat with no modulus, bounded by construction. FNV-1a
|||     would be the conventional choice, but wrapping 64-bit multiply needs
|||     `Data.Bits`, and a modulus in Nat needs an `Integral Nat` instance that is
|||     not in scope here. A subtraction-based modulo is not an option either: it
|||     is O(value / modulus) and hangs for an hour on a 2^64 modulus (measured).
|||     Field names are deliberately NOT included: renaming a field does not change
|||     the wire format, so it must not change the checksum.
layoutChecksum : Nat
layoutChecksum =
  weighted 0 allSizes * 1024

  + length allStructs

-- Cross-checks — nothing is emitted until these pass

||| Everything that can make this generator refuse to write.
